# news_by_zip 
Parker - axios functions, videos
Princeton - google api, suggested stories, etc
Robert - axios functions, css, sorting files in VS code (for ease of readability) etc 
Goal - use of two different apis in our application 
Made use of the resources posted to us by our teachers on schoology 
1st challenge finding an api that would give us good data to use 
Ziptastic and NewsApi 
Ziptastic - data stored about zipcodes,country, city, state 
Newsapi - returned an array titled articles. In this array was an object that included details of a specific article such as title, published date, an image, etc 
Thought we could combine these two apis and NEWS BY ZIP was created   
What it does/functionality 
	-User can enter in their zipcode on the website 
	-Behind the scenes an AXIOS get request is then made to our Ziptastic API and a city is retrieved from that zipcode. Then another get request is made to newsapi using by putting that city name(our output from our last get request) into their search endpoint and finally our webpage will load with news articles based on the city  
-users also have an option to search by interest 
- users can save stories to watch later or also click a button to read them right now 
-another api is used for our ticker to keep our site up to date about stocks   
-takes the users latitude and longitude and then creates a city then puts that data in suggested stories
Css 
We made use of many bootstrap elements including our nav bar , buttons and our responsive layout  
-made us of flex boxes and different animation tools we learned from Google 
Iframe  
-the ticker function is really cool
Challenges 
having never really worked in teams before on a project one of the major hardships was figuring out how to divide up the work 
Then came big obstacle of remembering git commands and working on gitHub 
Merge conflicts , having group members work on the same stuff we ran into problems  
Talking on the mute button

Problem solving  
-made good use of our instructors , Thanks Lachlan, Joe, Wes, it took a village 
- learning and messing up definitely served as a fundamental way for problem solving next time 
-console logging every variable
-hello google  
-asking a team member 
-knowing when to step away from the computer  
What we learned 
-Read documentation 
-No one loves merging 
-Git commands
